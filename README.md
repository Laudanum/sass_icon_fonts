Sass icon fonts
===============

Sass 3.2 integration for modern icon webfonts.

 * [Entypo] (native at 40px)
 * [Entypo Social][Entypo]
 * [Font Awesome] (native at 14px)
 * [Typicons] (native at 24px)

Why is it needed?
-----------------

The Sass/CSS files that these fonts provide usually give you a lot of cruft, and 
defines all the classes in one giant file.

Me, I prefer to not have them in my CSS files unless I need them.

This project provides mixins like so:

    +fa-icon(music, 24px)
